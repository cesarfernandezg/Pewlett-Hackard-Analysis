2. Unique Titles - this table holds the most recent title of each employee. This table is required because there are emplooyes with different titles due to promotions, so we need the only the most recent title. See image 2

## Task 2
Next the company wants to know all the employees that are eligible for the mentorship program. The following employees were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. The objective of this program is for retiring workers to train and mentor their successors. This with the goal of not having to pay all those who are going to retire and instead enter a part-time job.
See image 4 for a glimpse of the workers who are eligible for this program
